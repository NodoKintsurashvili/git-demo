Hey, you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?

Hey, you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?

Hey, you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight
Hey, you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?

Hey, you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
